            <span> Animals losing powers </span>
            <p>Every day, countless animals suffer in silence—abandoned, abused, and forgotten. My advocacy fights to give them a voice, protect their rights, and remind people that animals deserve compassion, safety, and love. Let’s stand up for those who can’t speak for themselves.</p>

            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>Shelter of Hope is a student-led advocacy that stands for compassion, responsibility, and respect for all living beings. 
            We started this journey because we believe that every animal deserves a safe, loving home and a life free from cruelty or neglect. 
            Our group was formed out of the desire to give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves.
            By raising awareness, we hope to show others that protecting animals is a reflection of kindness in society. 
            We are determined to make a change, starting from schools and even into families and local communities. 
            Through our hard work efforts, we want to create a culture where animals are valued as part of our shared world.</p>
