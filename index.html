                <h3>Background of the Problem </h3>
                <p>Millions of animals are being abandoned, neglected, or abused every year. Including factory farming,
                fur industry, wildlife exploitation and animal testing, making animals face abuse in many forms.
                Despite being living beings capable of feeling pain, they are treated badly rather than living things.
                However, there may be laws that exist to protect them, cases of animal cruelty continue to rise each year.</p>
                <p>Limited shelters, lack of awareness, and insufficient resources make it difficult to provide care for
                the numbers of strays in our community. This creates a cycle of suffering that continues to grow unless
                real action is taken. The fight for animal rights is not just about preventing cruelty, but promoting
                compassion, respect, and treatment for all living beings. Protecting animals also contributes to
                healthier ecosystems and a more humane society. <br>

                <h2>Current Efforts</h2>
                    <p>Many organizations in present are working to address animal cruelty. Shelters and rescue groups take actions
                    in taking care and make temporary homes for abandoned animals. There are also laws and regulations that exist
                    in many countries to support and protect animals from abuse, and raise awareness campaigns about responsible
                    in pet ownership and wild life protection.</p>
                    <p>In addition, other organizations such as the Animal Legal Defense Fund is in demand to protect animals from
                    harm, providing them assistance and training to people in fighting against animal cruelty, and they also
                    support animal protection. Overall, these efforts aim to achieve a more friendly and a peaceful society
                    for all living beings.</p>
